#Things I learned
- Loops
    - `while(this is true){run this code}`
    - `for(these variables; while this condition; after each loop){run this code}`
- Debugging
    - `println()`
    - narrow down code to find any problems
- If/else continued
    - `if(){}`
    - `else(){}`
    - `else if(){}`
- Git
    - `git branch _name` or `git checkout -b _name` to create a branch
    - `git checkout _name` to move to a particular file
    - `git commit`
    - `git merge _name` from the master, name is what you're merging into it
    - `git tag _tag` to add a tag to a commit
    - `git reset _toCommit` to reset to a previous commit and effectively remove what you've changed or merged into the master
